# 📈 Nicole Reiman – Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This is a curated collection of data science projects I've completed across academic, professional, and personal contexts.

🎓 I recently graduated with honors in **Data Science from ITBA (Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires)**.  
💼 I have two years of experience working with data at **La Nación**, covering both **audience analytics and business metrics**, as well as **data journalism**.  
Some of that work can be explored [here](https://shorturl.at/Fa6py).

This portfolio focuses on how data can drive **insights, growth, and strategy** — all central to the role of **Growth Analytics Lead**.
